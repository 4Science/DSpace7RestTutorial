# DSpace 7 REST Tutorial

Thank you for registering to attend the DSpace 7 REST API Tutorial.  The REST API will become the core interface for the future DSpace User Interface and any future applications that will be built on top of DSpace.

We look forward to sharing with the progress that has been made so far with the API and sharing with you the work yet to be done.  We hope you leave the workshop with greater knowledge and comfort with the REST API.  We also hope to inspire you to contribute your code, documentation, and testing skills to the development of the API.

## Welome

The workshop has been designed to offer something for attendees with various levels of experience with the DSpace code base.  

## Learning Objectives
- Learn the functionality that will be provided by the DSpace 7 REST API (everyone)
- Learn how to discover and understand the endpoints that are available in the API (everyone)
- Learn how to authenticate as a user of the DSpace REST API (everyone)
- Learn how to construct a simple application on top of the DSpace REST API (intermediate)
- Learn how to code a new endpoint within the REST API (experienced DSpace developers)

## Installation Suggestions

Based on your level of interest and experience with DSpace, you can choose one of the following installation/setup paths in preparation for the workshop.  Please install this software before the workshop.  Unfortunately, there will not be time to assist attendees with installation issues during the workshop.

If you are traveling without a laptop or if you do not have the pre-requisite software, please join us and plan to shadow another workshop participant.

### Installation Suggestions for Everyone
These recommendations will allow you to intract with a public instance of the DSpace REST API and to explore the avilable endpoints.

- A laptop with a browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)

### Intermediate Installation Suggestions for Developing a Simple App on top of REST
-These recommendations will allow you to create a simple web pagethat can interact with the REST api.
- Installation suggestions described above
- A text editor such as Notepad++, Atom
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) - this is a tool that makes it easy to construct and re-use REST API calls.
- A local web server.  If you do not have one, the following is available as a chrome extension.
  - [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related?hl=en)
  
### Installation instructions for experienced DSpace developers
In the last segment of the workshop, we will modify and deploy changes to the DSpace REST API using the lessons learned in the workshop.  In order to perform this step, you will need a local instance of DSpace on your desktop.  Unfortunately, these installation requirements are not trivial. This step is recommended for experienced DSpace developers.  __We will be unable to troubleshoot desktop installation issues during the workshop__.

Note: based on the reliability of the venue internet, these steps could also be accomplished by remoting into your development/test environment.

Other workshop participants will be invited to shadow experienced developers for this portion of the workshop.

- All of the suggested software listed above
- Java JDK, Maven, Ant
- Java IDE such as Eclipse
- Postgres
- Tomcat

# DSpace 7 REST Tutorial Objectives and Installation Pre-requisites

{% include nav.html %}

Thank you for registering to attend the DSpace 7 REST API Tutorial.  The REST API will become the core interface for the future DSpace User Interface and any future applications that will be built on top of DSpace.

We look forward to sharing with the progress that has been made so far with the API and sharing with you the work yet to be done.  We hope you leave the workshop with greater knowledge and comfort with the REST API.  We also hope to inspire you to contribute your code, documentation, and testing skills to the development of the API.

## Welome

The workshop has been designed to offer something for attendees with various levels of experience with the DSpace code base.  

## Learning Objectives
- Learn the functionality that will be provided by the DSpace 7 REST API (everyone)
- Learn how to discover and understand the endpoints that are available in the API (everyone)
- Learn how to authenticate as a user of the DSpace REST API (everyone)
- Learn how to construct a simple application on top of the DSpace REST API (intermediate)
- Learn the architecture and design principles of the REST API (everyone)
- Learn how to code a new endpoint within the REST API (experienced DSpace developers)

## Installation Suggestions

Based on your level of interest and experience with DSpace, you can choose one of the following installation/setup paths in preparation for the workshop.  Please install this software before the workshop.  Unfortunately, there will not be time to assist attendees with installation issues during the workshop.

If you are traveling without a laptop or if you do not have the pre-requisite software, please join us and plan to shadow another workshop participant.

### Installation recommendation
These recommendations will allow you to interact with a public instance of the DSpace REST API and to explore the available endpoints.
- A laptop with a browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)

### Optional Installation
-These recommendations will allow you to simulate an application that can interact with the REST api.
- A text editor such as Notepad++, Atom
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) - this is a tool that makes it easy to construct and re-use REST API calls.

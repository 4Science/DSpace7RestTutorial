=== Rest Tutorial



REST architecture - discussion of stack components and principles
Discussion of code goals 
json structure standards
Disucssion of test goals
Disucssion of documentation goals

Step through another object such as item or bitstream?

Code / develop new endpoints (integrate into code base during meeting)
Or construct a mock object
Question - if we intend to re-use this training, perhaps we should create a mock object
